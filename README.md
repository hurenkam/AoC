This is where i keep my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles.

See https://adventofcode.com for more info.

Note that although i don't particularly like slow code, my main aim here is not to have the fastest code. My main goal is for the code to be as readable and as clean as possible, while still solving the puzzles in a reasonable timeframe.
